# Foundation 3 HTML5 Boilerplate

This is a html5 boilerplate (or snippet, or anything you want to call it =p) to begin a new Foundation's project.

## Usage

Simply change the harcoded paths in file ("path-to-your-css") and start!

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

This file was borned of my needs in the company that I'm working. We started a new project every month, and copy-paste was boring. So, I've made this boilerplate to simplify our work. Hope you enjoy!
